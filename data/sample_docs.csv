1,"Introduction to Machine Learning","Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data."
2,"Natural Language Processing","NLP is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It helps machines understand, interpret and manipulate human language."
3,"Deep Learning Basics","Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers. These deep neural networks can automatically learn hierarchical features from data."
4,"Vector Databases","Vector databases are specialized systems designed to store and query embeddings or vector representations of data. They're optimized for similarity search operations."
5,"Semantic Search Explained","Semantic search is a data searching technique where a search query aims to not only find keywords but understand the contextual meaning of the search terms to improve accuracy."
6,"AWS EC2 Instances","Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud. It allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own applications."
7,"FAISS for Vector Search","Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) is a library that allows developers to quickly search for embeddings of multimedia documents that are similar to each other."
8,"Text Embeddings","Text embeddings are numerical representations of text in a continuous vector space where semantically similar texts are mapped to nearby points."
9,"FastAPI Development","FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints. It's designed to be easy to use and high performance."
10,"Sentence Transformers","Sentence Transformers is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, paragraph and image embeddings. The models are based on transformer networks like BERT."
